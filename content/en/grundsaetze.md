# Mission statement

Code For Germany is a network of groups of volunteer volunteers who use their skills to make their cities and social life positive. They are committed to more transparency, open data and participation in their cities. In particular, they mediate between civil society, administration and politics and use their skills to improve communication between them and provide the necessary impetus so that the opportunities of open and free digitization benefit as many people as possible.


## 1. Preamble

Code for Germany is a project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, in which groups of volunteer volunteers get involved in local labs. With this Code of Conduct we regulate the essential principles for working and for cooperation within the framework of the Code for Germany network. These serve as guiding principles for the behavior among each other as well as the external appearance. The events of the regional Code for Germany groups are basically open. Anyone who participates, communicates via the communication channels and / or otherwise appears as part of the Code for Germany network recognizes this Code of Conduct as binding.

## 2. Organization of the labs

To open a new lab, the Open Knowledge Foundation (info@codefor.de) is contacted. In joint discussions it is evaluated whether a start-up is possible and makes sense for both sides. The project management also consults the Community Council. If the decision is positive, the OKF will assist the new lab in addressing potential interested parties and strategic partners in organizing a kick-off event.

The lab leads organize and develop the labs in their cities. They organize events by taking care of rooms and invitations. They help build a local community in their labs by addressing and inviting interested parties and creating an atmosphere that is inviting for new participants. They are primary contacts for the local community and for the Open Knowledge Foundation. Lab leads are determined within the labs, this can be done by choice or based on a consensus principle at a lab meeting. However, this must be announced beforehand via the internal channels at least two weeks in advance. There should be at least two lab leads that represent each other and share the tasks. The Code For Labs and its participants speak and act in their own name. A reference to the Open Knowledge Foundation and Code for Germany is expressly desired.

The lab leads are responsible for the organization of the lab and the events. You are the contact person for your lab and for the project management of Code for Germany. The OK Labs and their participants speak and act in their own name. A reference to the Open Knowledge Foundation and Code for Germany is expressly desired.

## 3. Representation and community advice

The community chooses a “Council” for the better overall organization of the labs among themselves and for cooperation with the OKF. This consists of up to 5 people and is elected for one year. All members from the labs who have registered on the Code For Germany mailing list up to one week before the start of the election are entitled to vote. With the election, the labs express their express trust in the advisory board and elect them as representatives of the interests of the labs.

The Community Council is an elected body made up of representatives of the labs, which is consulted by the project management for strategic decisions. The council supports the project management in planning and creating strategies for growth, communication, content orientation, etc. by representing the perspective and needs of the labs and thus helping to shape the development of the program. The Council is listed as an official body on the Code for Germany website.

## 4. Decision making

The Code for Germany Community strives to make decisions by consensus. The community is consulted for important decisions regarding the program or a public statement. Information and options are prepared in an understandable way and the feedback from the community is obtained in a consultation phase of at least one week. Should a faster consultation be necessary, decisions can be made in consultation with the Community Council.

## 5. Behavior with each other

Within the Code for Germany network, we want to ensure that people can contribute and feel good regardless of gender, sexual orientation, origin, belief, appearance, religion or age. We do not tolerate sexist, racist, homophobic or trans-hostile, disservice or otherwise marginalized groups of discriminatory statements - even if they were "just a joke".

The Lab Leads are responsible for compliance with the Code of Conduct and accordingly ensure that an environment is created that enables respectful interaction with one another. Interested parties are welcome.

In cases of conflict and violations of the Code of Conduct, a solution is being worked on within the lab. If this does not lead to a solution, the participants contact the Community Council and the project management. Together they advise on how to proceed. The goal for us is to resolve conflicts through arbitration. In the event of unsuccessful dispute resolution and persistent violations, the project management at the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, after prior consultation with the Community Council, may decide to exclude a person from the relevant lab and the Code for Germany network and to meet them. Lab Leads and Community Council members can also be affected by this exclusion.
