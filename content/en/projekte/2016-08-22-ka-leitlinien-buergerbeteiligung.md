Many cities have guidelines or concepts for citic participation.
We want to develop a platform on which these can be read, commented on and developed in a structured manner.

Technically speaking, we work with text extraction with Apache Tika and indexing / full-text search with Elastic Search. The concept is of course exciting for many other topics - we wanted to start with a manageable topic in order to gain experience.
