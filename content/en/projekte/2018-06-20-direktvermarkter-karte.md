Overview map of farm shops, markets, milk vending machines and other direct marketers from the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). The map receives all of its data via a script from Openstreetmap, prepares it optically and supports the maintenance of the data by making missing values ​​visible and linking directly to the corresponding location on OSM and other map services.

Missing locations can be added on Openstreetmap using the tags shop = farm, amenity = vending_machine (vending = milk or vending = food, ...) or amenity = marketplace. You can find details on this in the menu of the map.
